## Inspiration
Surgeries occur daily in many hospitals across the US. There are many procedures, steps, protocols, and measures needed to be done during the surgeries. Thus, training doctors and nurses about surgeries, anatomy, and human bodies is very important since understanding well about human body parts help them navigate, detect, and resolve surgical issues faster during surgeries. 

Further, although reading materials is important, there is a need for doctors and nurses to have practical training and have an interesting way to learn through Metaverse. In order for doctors and nurses to have firm knowledge about human bodies parts during surgeries and fasten the surgery process, nurses and doctors need to be trained well when they were students. Even when medical students graduated and work in health care field as nurses or doctors, they still need continuous training about human bodies which involves study of major body structures. Thus, we would like to  develop a Metaverse  environment in which various people can join and learn.

## What it does
- A health care training environment for multiple medical students, nurses, and doctors to visit and learn. 
- Users can withdraw and deposit ICX funds using ICX Wallet. They can pay the monthly ICX funds to  access ICXistic Metaverse to study about health care

## How we built it
We built using Icon SDK, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Unity, #C, go, Java, Python

## Deployed ICX Transaction

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to learn new blockchain technology of ICX and brought everything together to work in a Dapp

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to build the Dapp and explained about its functions

## What we learned
We learnt about Icon SDK and how to deploy ICX contracts

## What's next for ICXISTIC
We would like to bring more functions to the Metaverse with ICON blockchain technology as center
